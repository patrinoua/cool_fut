### Built with React Native

A nice looking UI, where the customer can update their details.
The customer is able to see the following data + edit the data 
- First name
- Last name 
- Passport number 
- Street Address 
- Postal code 
- Country 
- Email address 
- Password 
- User name / Avatar name
- Avatar photo 

Changing critical data such as passport number, email address, password invokes extra
validations. 
For example you cannot change the passport details without going through the
Know Your Customer. 
Simple validations such as strength of the password + re-entering the password are implemented.
